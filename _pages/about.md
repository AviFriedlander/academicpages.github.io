Welcome to my website! This website is still under construction so I will be slowly adding more information in the future. For now, this website serves two main pages. The ["Physics"](/research) page describes my research interests and some of the projects I have worked on so far as a graduate student. Physics is not my only interest though and I want a place to write about other projects I work on. Therefore, the ["Blog/Coding Projects"](/year-archive) page contains a blog where I will write articles about different coding projects I work on. These coding projects will mostly relating to hockey analytics however that may change if I think of other topics I would like to explore. If you would like to contact me, please feel free to use any of the methods in the sidebar on the left of this page.


About Me
-------------
I am a PhD candidate studying Theoretical Astroparticle Physics at Queen's University under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Vincent. My research focuses on trying to gain insight into the fundamental nature of Dark Matter and other Beyond the Standard Model physics theories through the signatures they leave in the early universe.

My Masters was done at McGill University under the supervision of Dr. Jim Cline. There, I studied the viability of Electroweak Baryogenesis as a solution to the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem. We did so by calculating the speed at which bubbles would grow during the Electroweak Phase Transition in the early universe.

Before becoming a theoretical physicist I completed an Engineering Physics degree at Queen's University. I was in the computing option of the Engineering Physics program so my degree consisted of a mixture of physics, engineering design, and computing courses.
