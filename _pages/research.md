Research Interests
==============
The shortest description I have of my research is that I study particles in space. More broadly, I try and use observations of space to better understand the fundamental building blocks of the Universe and the laws that govern them. During my PhD I have specifically been studying the impact different dark matter models have on astrophysical processes. This has resulted in a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11761) where I, along with a group of collaborators studied the observational signatures that would be created by primordial black holes in theories with additional dimensions. My masters research focused on determining the details of bubble growth during a strong electroweak phase transition in the early universe which is important for understnading whether that phase transition is able to provide an explanation for the observed matter - anti-matter asymmetry.
